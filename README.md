Maintenance Tracker App is an application that provides users with the ability to reach out to operations or repairs department regarding repair or maintenance requests and monitor the status of their request.

# Description
The user makes requests following certain criteria from their home page and those requests are sent to the admin who then has permissions to approve or disapprove a specific request based on any certain reason.
The admin as well flags requests as done or pending depending on whether or not the requests have been attended to or not.

# Installation
The application is currently still a website only but work is underway to bring a mobile app on board.

# Future
The application is currrently using non-persistent data but work is underway to intergrate a database system where persistent data will be introduced.
